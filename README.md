### Learning Assembly

I know very little in Assembly, so this shouldn't take too long to write out

#### Comments in Assembly

```assembly
; This is a comment
```

I don't think multi-line comments are supported in Assembly

#### Hello World in Assembly

I don't know how to make a Hello World program in Assembly, as I don't know the correct output keyword or sequence.

#### MOV (move) keyword in Assembly

I am not too experienced with this keyword, but I know it is a core part of Assembly.

Here is a sample from `Wikimedia://EN/Wikipedia/Org`

```assembly
MOV AL, 1h        ; Load AL with immediate value 1
MOV CL, 2h        ; Load CL with immediate value 2
MOV DL, 3h        ; Load DL with immediate value 3
```
